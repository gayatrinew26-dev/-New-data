Call Center Data Analysis Dashboard
Overview

This project presents an analytical dashboard for call center operations. The dashboard provides key metrics related to emergency calls, response efficiency, ambulance usage, and lives saved across different districts. It aims to provide insights to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

Key Metrics

Total Calls: 8,001

Lives Saved: 2,848

Average Response Time: 15.04 minutes

Fuel Cost: 3M (monetary unit not specified)

Average Downtime: 30.11 minutes

Most Called Service: Police (based on call type analysis)

Insights
Call Distribution

By Call Type:
The calls are almost evenly distributed among Police (25.1%), Agriculture (25.07%), Medical (24.96%), and Fire (24.87%). This shows a balanced demand for services with a slight edge for Police-related emergencies.

By District:
Total calls per district range from 570 to 663, with the highest activity in the first few districts. This helps identify districts requiring additional resources or monitoring.

Operational Efficiency

Average Downtime by Ambulance Type:

BLS: 30.70 mins

Bike: 30.09 mins

ALS: 29.96 mins

Boat: 29.69 mins
Boat and ALS ambulances show slightly lower downtimes, suggesting faster readiness and deployment.

Lives Saved

By Gender:

Male: 48.9%

Female: 51.0%
This indicates that emergency interventions are almost equally distributed between genders.

Geographical Analysis

The dashboard includes a map view of call locations across the region, highlighting high-activity areas. This visualization supports geographical resource planning and targeted response strategies.

Conclusion

The dashboard effectively highlights critical KPIs for call center operations:

Balanced call type distribution ensures resources are allocated across all emergency types.

Downtime metrics indicate areas for potential operational improvement.

Gender and district-level insights allow for equitable and targeted emergency response planning.

This analysis can be extended with:

Temporal trends (daily/weekly/monthly) for calls.

Predictive analysis to forecast peak periods.

Resource optimization based on downtimes and high-activity zones.# -New-data
